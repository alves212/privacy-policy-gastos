    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> July 2025</p>

    <p>
      This app, <strong>GASTOS</strong>, is a personal finance tracker developed
      and maintained by <strong>David Alves da Silva</strong> for personal and
      private use only.
    </p>

    <h2>Information Collection and Use</h2>
    <p>
      The app collects only the data entered by the user, such as income,
      expenses, and login credentials (email and password). This data is
      securely stored in Firebase Firestore and is only accessible to the
      authenticated user.
    </p>

    <h2>Data Storage</h2>
    <p>
      All user data is stored in Firebase and protected by security rules that
      ensure only the account owner can access their own data.
    </p>

    <h2>Data Sharing</h2>
    <p>
      No user data is shared with third parties. As the developer, I have
      technical access to Firebase infrastructure, but I do not intentionally
      access any user's data.
    </p>

    <h2>Security</h2>
    <p>
      The app uses email and password authentication, along with Firebase's
      built-in security features to protect user information.
    </p>

    <h2>Data Deletion</h2>
    <p>
      Users can delete their account at any time. This will permanently remove
      all associated data from Firebase.
    </p>

    <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>
      This privacy policy may be updated from time to time. Significant changes
      will be communicated within the app.
    </p>

    <h2>Contact</h2>
    <p>
      If you have any questions or requests regarding this policy, please
      contact the developer at: <strong>apazareynaldo212390@gmail.com</strong>
